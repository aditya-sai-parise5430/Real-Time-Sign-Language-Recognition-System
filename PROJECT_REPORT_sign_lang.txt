📘 PROJECT REPORT
Real-Time Sign Language Recognition System using MediaPipe & LSTM
1. Introduction

Sign language is a primary means of communication for the hearing- and speech-impaired community. However, communication barriers exist between sign language users and people unfamiliar with sign language.

This project aims to bridge that gap by developing a real-time Sign Language Recognition System that:

Detects hand gestures through a camera

Recognizes ASL (American Sign Language) alphabets (A–Z)

Builds meaningful words from continuous gestures

Displays confidence metrics for prediction reliability

Provides a premium, interactive user interface

The system uses computer vision and deep learning techniques for accurate and real-time performance.

2. Problem Statement

Traditional sign language translation requires:

Human interpreters

Specialized hardware (gloves, sensors)

These approaches are:

Expensive

Not scalable

Not always available

Objective

To create a camera-based, software-only, real-time sign language recognition system that runs on a normal laptop using:

Webcam

Python

Open-source libraries

5. Dataset Collection (From Scratch – Skipped Step Explained)
5.1 What Data is Required?

For each ASL letter (A–Z):

Multiple gesture samples

Each sample = sequence of 30 frames

Each frame = 21 landmarks × (x, y, z)

So:

One frame  → 63 values
One sample → 30 × 63 = 1890 values

5.2 How Data is Collected

A data collection script:

Opens webcam

Uses MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks

Saves landmark sequences as .npy files

Organizes them by letter class

Example structure:

dataset/
 ├── A/
 │   ├── sample_1.npy
 │   ├── sample_2.npy
 ├── B/
 ├── C/
 ...
 └── Z/


📌 You skipped this step because your senior already provided a 4.9 GB pre-collected dataset, which is common in real projects.

6. Data Preprocessing

Steps applied:

Load .npy landmark files

Ensure uniform sequence length (30 frames)

Normalize values if required

Assign numerical labels:

A → 0, B → 1, ..., Z → 25


Split dataset:

Training set

Validation set

7. Model Design (LSTM)
7.1 Why LSTM?

Sign language is temporal:

A single frame is insufficient

Gesture meaning depends on motion over time

LSTM is ideal for:

Sequence learning

Time-series data

Gesture recognition

7.2 Model Architecture (Simplified)
Input: (30, 63)

Dense Layer
↓
Softmax (26 outputs)


Output: Probability distribution over A–Z

Highest probability → predicted letter

8. Model Training (Skipped but Explained)

Training process:

Feed landmark sequences into model

Use categorical cross-entropy loss

Optimizer: Adam

Train for multiple epochs

Save:

Model architecture (.json)

Weights (.h5)

You used pre-trained models like:

model33k.json

newmodel33k.h5

✔ This is standard industry practice (transfer learning / reuse).

9. Real-Time Inference Pipeline
9.1 Camera Input

OpenCV captures frames from webcam

Supports internal & external USB cameras

Frame resized to fit fullscreen UI

9.2 Hand Detection

MediaPipe detects:

Palm

21 landmarks

Outputs (x, y, z) coordinates

9.3 Sequence Management

Each frame’s landmarks added to buffer

Buffer size = 30 frames

Sliding window approach

9.4 Prediction Logic

LSTM predicts probabilities

Prediction accepted only if:

Same letter predicted for 12 consecutive frames

Confidence ≥ 0.9

This avoids false positives and flickering output.

10. Word Builder Logic
Controls:
Key	Function
SPACE	Add detected letter
BACKSPACE	Remove last letter
ENTER	Clear word
Q	Exit application
Logic:

Prevents duplicate letters

Allows user-controlled word formation

Mimics natural typing behavior

11. Confidence Monitoring
11.1 Confidence Percentage Bar

Shows confidence of current prediction

Color-coded:

High confidence → Yellow/Green

Low confidence → Red

11.2 Confidence History Graph

Displays confidence trend over time

Model stability

Prediction consistency
